# Word Counter in C++

## Introduction

This repository contains a simple and efficient word counter written in C++. It reads a text file, counts the frequency of each word, and outputs the results to another text file.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Word Counting**: The program reads through the text file and counts the frequency of each word.
- **Case Insensitive**: The word counting is case insensitive, meaning 'Word' and 'word' are considered the same.
- **Special Character Handling**: The program correctly handles special characters like '!', '?', '.', and ','.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ionut767/word-counter-cpp.git
cd WordCounter
```

2. Compile and run the program:

```bash
g++ wordcount.cpp -o a.out
./a.out
```

## Conclusion

This program is a simple and efficient word counter written in C++. It reads a text file, counts the frequency of each word, and outputs the results to another text file. Some improvements can be made, such as case-insensitive word counting, special character handling, and more.
